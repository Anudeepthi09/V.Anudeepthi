    <h2>World cutest bird</h2>      
    <p>The tropical parula (Setophaga pitiayumi) is a small New World warbler. It breeds from southernmost Texas and northwest Mexico (Sonora) south through Central America to northern Argentina, including Trinidad and Tobago. This widespread and common species is not considered threatened by the IUCN
        It is 4.3 in (11 cm) long and has mainly blue-grey upperparts, with a greenish back patch and two white wing bars. The underparts are yellow, becoming orange on the breast. The male has a black patch from the bill to behind the eye.

Females are slightly duller than males and lack black on the head. The immature tropical parula is dull-plumaged, lacks the wing bars, and has a grey band on the breast.

The tropical parula has about 14 subspecies, with a wide range of plumage tones. S. p. graysoni, is endemic to Socorro in the Revillagigedo Islands.[3] Some subspecies (especially insular ones) are occasionally considered separate species.
